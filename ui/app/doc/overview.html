<h1>Notes</h1>

<h2>What is Notes?</h2>
<p>Notes is a web based, offline capable <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Progressive Web App</a> for notes taking. It is compatible to every device running a recent browser, but can also be installed locally as a PWA. All functionality is also available when there is no internet connection, and optimized for mobile as well as desktop usage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea to create this was the lack of existing major note taking apps which are either too unstable or intransparent when it goes about synchronizing errors and conflicts, too big and unresponsive, or did not provide all functionality i needed personally. For example, here you can have kanban boards inside tree structured documents, which can have further sub-boards etc, not limited in any way. Also there is both WYSIWYG and code style editing in the same app, which is also unique.</p>
<p>The app stores and manages textual notes, PDF documents, images and any other type of attachment files, in an unrestricted hierarchical way. This means that every document can have child documents, as deep as necessary. There are multiple ways of accessing and querying the documents, as well as multiple editors to choose from, providing rich text (WYSIWYG) editing as well as markdown based and source code editors. Additionally, the app provides a kanban board view similar to Trello or the like, all integrated in one place.</p>
<p>The documents can be labeled, referenced, and there is a history for all textual documents so you never loose anything by accidentally deleting a note or parts of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are multiple ways of importing and exporting documents, for example Trello boards can be imported directly. The app is Open Source, so you can add your own importers/exporters if you are familiar with Javascript. See the technical documentation for more details on this.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>See <a href="#/doc">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Source Code</h2>
<p>The project is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/Tunetown/Notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github</a>.</p>
<h2>Technical Overview</h2>
<p>The app is based on pure HTML/Javascript and a <a href="https://couchdb.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CouchDB</a> backend. This database is document based, so it is well suitable for this application, and also the <a href="https://pouchdb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PouchDB</a> library provides the synchronizing mechanisms to be able to fully use the app when there is no network connection to the CouchDB server.</p>
<p>The data is stored in JSON format (native to CouchDB) internally. One notebook is represented by one database in CouchDB. A copy of the database containing the complete notebook can be held locally in the browser's app storage, so if you make changes to a document while being offline, the changes will be synchronized whenever there is a connection to the server again (this is what PouchDB does).</p>
<p>If there are conflicts with other client instances changing the same document, the user is noticed about this and has to decide which version is the correct one (manual conflict resolution, described in the Usage Documentation).</p>

<h2>Support the project</h2>
<p>This project is completely open source and has no budget or anything, so if you use it, please consider donating to make it possible to carry on fixing bugs and developing new features! Thanks in advance, even a small donation makes a difference.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>The UI part of the app (HTML and JavaScript) is hosted as a purely static web page on any simple web server which can serve HTML and JS files. You can clone the Github repository to a server of your own or simply use this link if you don't want to host it yourself or just want to try it out:</p>
<p><a href="https://notes.webertom.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://notes.webertom.net</a></p>
<p>The server part is simply represented by a <a href="https://couchdb.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CouchDB </a>instance, no PHP or any other server side scripts are needed. You can either <a href="https://docs.couchdb.org/en/3.2.0/install/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deploy your own CouchDB instance</a> on your own server (CouchDB is available for a variety of operating systems and environments), or use a hosted database provider. However, you have to take care to get no <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS?retiredLocale=de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CORS</a> problems, so configure your CouchDB instance accordingly, but the best practice is to host the app code on the same server as the database instance to prevent CORS errors from the start.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: For an initial test, it is also possible to just work with the local database of the app. You can test all functionality (except synchronizing with a remote database of course) of the app before you get hold of a CouchDB instance, which might cause further setup work or costs (if you choose a hosted service for example). Just open the app in your browser and choose the "local" profile, see the Usage documentation for details.</em></p>
<h2>To Do</h2>
<p>There is a lot to do on the project, however these are the key points which have to be addressed (feel free to tell me more):</p>
<ul>
<li>Background images for Items</li>
<li>Tabs in the editor area</li>
<li>Open deep references: Currently, a reference only shows the referenced document. To access its eventual children, you have to use "Show in navigation" in the page menu first.</li>
<li>Optimizing multi user access:
<ul>
<li>Log user name on changes,&nbsp;</li>
<li>Currently no document-based access scheme is possible. When sharing a document, the other person has to have full access to the database.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Add a publish option to mirror a document to a public place?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>The app does not send any data from the user anywhere else than to the CouchDB server you provide yourself, so no legal disclaimer is necessary, you manage your data yourself. Use at your own risk, and read the License above.</p>
